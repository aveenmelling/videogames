This is my final project for an 8 week Python kickstarter course with Code First Girls. 

I downloaded three videogames data sets from Kaggle and used various Python libraries (pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib) to create data frames and join, clean, analyse and visualise the data. 

Please feel free to download the slide set I used to see the output of each block of code, or the Jupyter notebook to try running it yourself :)
